## Project Overview
This project aims to classify ASL alphabet gestures (A-Z) using deep learning. The system can:
- Recognize static ASL alphabet signs from images
- Real-time detection using webcam input
- Achieve high classification accuracy through convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## Features
- ASL Alphabet Classification (26 classes)
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- CNN-based deep learning model
- Real-time webcam prediction capability
- Model training and evaluation scripts

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esraa-Mohamedd/American-Sign-Language-ASL-.git
cd American-Sign-Language-ASL-
